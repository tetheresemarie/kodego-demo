            <div class="row">
              <div class="col">

          </div>
          <div class="content-1">   
            <p> A land title is essential to demonstrate to the public that you legitimately own a piece of property. Whether you're buying a 
                house or just a parcel of land, full ownership in the Philippines involves the transfer of land title.
  
            <p>Property buyers must not only understand this process. Property agents and sellers should be familiar with the process of 
                transferring ownership from the previous owner to the new owner.</p>
              
            <p>If you are a property buyer, make it clear to the seller and the broker or agent who should handle the land title transfer. 
                However, if you want to do it yourself, you should understand the complexities of the procedure and how to carry it out.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>What are the Transfer of Title Requirements and Steps?</h4>  
            <br>
            <p> Property buyers should be aware that the deadline to transfer the land title in the Philippines begins once the deed of 
                sale is signed and notarized. The buyer should have already made arrangements with the seller and broker to expedite the title transfer process.

            <h5>Step 1: Prepare the Requirements for Transfer of Title</h5>
            <p>Make sure you have the original copy and at least two photocopies of the following:</p>
               <li>Deed of Sale</li> 
               <li>Tax Identification Number and ID of the buyer and the seller</li>
               <li>Transfer Certificate of Title for a house or a lot</li>
               <li>Condominium Certificate of Title (for condominiums)/li>Condominium Certificate of Title (for condominiums)
               <li>Tax Clearance</li>
               <li>Tax Declaration</li>
               <li>Real Property Tax for the current year</li>
               <li>Management certificate from the condominium admin</li>
               <li>Certificate of non tenancy from the condominium admin</li>
               <li>Photo of the property for sale</li>
               <li>Sworn Declaration of No Improvements to show that the sold property hasnâ€™t incurred any improvements</li>
               <li>Special Power of Attorney (SPA) if the person signing is not the owner indicated in the Deed of Sale</li>
               <li>Certificate of the Philippine Consulate if the SPA was executed abroad</li>
               <li>Marriage Certificate, Birth Certificate, and Certificate of No Marriage</li>
               <li>Vicinity map or location map of the property</li> 
               <li>Other documents required by the Register of Deeds, like consolidation of ownership or mortgage settlement</li>
               <br>
               <div class="container text-center">
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col">
                    <img src="assets/mp40.JPG" width="1000px" height="600px" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>          
            <h5>Step 2: Submit all the Required Documents for Tax Computation</h5>
            <p>Once the deed of sale is signed and notarized, you need to submit it to the Regional Office of the 
            Bureau of Internal Revenue covering the jurisdiction of your property along with other required documents.</p>
            <p>The BIR representative will evaluate your documents and start computing for the Capital Gains Tax [3] 
            (CGT-BIR Form 1706) or Creditable Withholding Tax (CWT-BIR FORM 1606).</p>
            <p>Take note that the Capital Gains Tax should be paid within 30 days from the date of notarization, 
            and DST[4] should be paid on the nearest fifth day of the month after the notarization date. Make sure to 
            comply to avoid penalties and fines.</p>
            <br>
            <h5>Step 3: Pay the Required Taxes</h5>
            <p>You may now proceed to the Authorized Agent Bank (AAB) duly accredited by the BIR and pay the required 
            Documentary Stamp Tax, Value Added Tax, and Capital Gains Tax. </p>
            <p>Prepare the following documents which you might also need:</p>
            <li>Signed computation sheet from the BIR</li>
            <li>Deed of Conveyance - A document that indicates the transfer of ownership from the previous owner or seller to the buyer</li> 
            <li>Three copies of duly filled out BIR Form 1706 for Capital Gains Tax signed by the seller</li>
            <li>Three copies of filled out BIR Form 2000-OT to pay for Documentary Stamp signed by the buyer</li>

          </tbody>
          </table>
        <div class="content-2">
          <h5>Step 4: Get a Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR)</h5>
          <p>The Certificate of Authorizing Registration (CAR) is mandated by the National Internal Revenue Code. Itâ€™s a tax clearance document
            and proof that all taxes entailed with the sold property have been settled accordingly.</p>
          <p>You can claim the CAR as scheduled along with these documents which should have already been stamped by the BIR:</p>
              <li> Deed of Sale - Original copy stamped received by the BIR</li>
              <li>Copy of the CCT or TCT as received by the BIR</li>
              <li>Copies of the Form 2000 (DST and the BIR Form 1706 CGT) stamped received by the BIR</li>
              <li>Declaration for land and improvement</li>
              <li>Youâ€™ll receive two copies of the CAR. The brown copy is for you to keep while the blue copy is for you to use during 
                  the transfer.</li>
          <br>
          <h5>Step 5: Submit the CAR to the Local Treasurerâ€™s Office</h5>
          <p>At this stage, you need to submit your CAR to the local Treasurerâ€™s Office for the Transfer Tax. Make sure to pay the 
            Transfer Tax within 60 days after the notarization of the Deed of Conveyance.</p>
          <p>Upon payment, the Treasurerâ€™s Office will provide you with a receipt as proof of payment of Transfer Tax. 
            Youâ€™ll then need to go back to the BIR to have the Deed of Conveyance stamped.</p>
          <p>After this stage, you should have the original Deed of Conveyance stamped marked and signed by both the BIR and 
            the Treasurerâ€™s Office.</p>
          <h5>Step 6: Submit the Documents to the Registry of Deeds for Registration</h5>
          <p>Itâ€™s now time to register your property. You can now proceed to the Registry of Deeds and submit the following:</p>
              <li>Deed of Conveyance</li>
              <li>Deed of Absolute Sale</li>
              <li>Copies of IDs of all signatories</li>
              <li>Official Receipt of Notary Public used to notarize the Deed of Sale</li>
              <li>Certified True Copy of the Original Land Title</li>
              <li>Tax Clearance</li>
              <li>Latest Tax Declaration</li>
              <li>Clearances from the Home Owners Association, if applicable</li>
              <li>Birth Certificate</li>
              <li>Certificate of No Marriage</li>
              <li>Marriage Certificate</li>
          <br>
          <p>Once you've submitted the required documents and paid for the registration fees, you usually need to wait for two weeks 
            before you can acquire the new land title under your name. </p>
          
          <h5>Step 7: Secure a New Tax Declaration from the Local Assessorâ€™s Office</h5>
