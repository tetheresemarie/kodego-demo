        <h2>Philippine sugar output continues to drop</h2>
        <em><i>https://www.philstar.com/</i></em>
        <p><strong>Manila, PHILIPPINES</strong> - As the crop year is set to end in a few months, the country's sugar output remains on the 
        downtrend due to unfavorable weather conditions coupled with the damages caused by a typhoon late last year, according to the Sugar 
        Regulatory Administration (SRA). In a circular letter addressed to various sugar industry groups, SRA Administrator Hermenegildo Serafica 
        said the country's sugar production reached only 1.8 million metric tons (MT) as of June 15. 'The unusual decline in sugar production was 
        explicitly observed in Negros from March 2022 to May 2022 production data,' he said.Serafica explained the aberrant decline during the said 
        months was due to the residual effect on the damaged leaves of sugarcane caused by strong winds during the onslaught of Typhoon Odette 
        (Super Typhoon Rai), which hit the country late last year.</p>

        <h2><u><i>Editorial:</u></i>Shortage, food inflation to push up living expenses</h2>
        <p><strong>Bahay Kubo</strong> vegetable prices spiked P10-P100 per kilo last week. Eggplant, tomato, gourd, squash, radish, mustard, beans, cabbage, lettuce 
        are becoming unaffordable. <u>The <strong>-Ber months</strong> of the long Filipino Yuletide have just begun.</u> Data indicate worse times ahead. Five years of bad 
        governance have clobbered the vegetable and fruit sector. Over-importation and unabated agri-smuggling drove many planters out of business. Weather 
        disturbances, tripling of fertilizer rates and costly transport fuel and warehouse electricity finished off the stragglers. Rosendo So, chairman of 
        Samahang Industriya ng Agrikultura, does not see production recovering soon. Spices are expensive - if one can find onion, garlic, ginger and chili at all. 
        Few grew red onion this season, says Ronnie Ringor of Pangasinan. White variety sells for a staggering P450-P500 a kilo. Last summer the government let the 
        import cartel flood Luzon with cheap Indian shallot, the first time since 1946. With no storage support, Mindoro farmers had to burn nine million kilos of rotting 
        produce. The cartelists were identified in two Senate hearings last June and again last week. Government has not put them behind bars for no-bail, life-term economic 
        sabotage.</p>
