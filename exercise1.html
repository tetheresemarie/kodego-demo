        <h2>Manila, Jakarta deals to build Asean peace</h2>
         <p>AFTER his "very productive" state visit to Jakarta, President Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. expressed confidence that the agreements 
            entered into by the Philippines and Indonesia will build "a peaceful and more united" Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
            In a Facebook post, Marcos thanked President Joko Widodo, first lady Iriana Widodo, government ministries and the Indonesian people 
            for their "kindness and hospitality." 
            "We are confident that the agreements signed between our countries will help build a peaceful and more united Asean region," he said.
            Marcos' three-day state visit to Indonesia yielded at least four agreements in defense, cultural cooperation and economy.
            The signed deals were presented to Marcos and Widodo on Monday after their bilateral meeting at the Teratai Hall of the Bogor Presidential 
            Palace in West Java, Indonesia.</p>

        <h2>Tropical depression likely to enter PH, to be named 'Inday'</h2>
          <p>THE Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) said on Wednesday that the active tropical 
            depression outside the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) is likely to enter the country either tonight or Thursday morning.
            Once inside PAR, the tropical cyclone will be named "Inday," the first weather disturbance this month, according to weather specialist 
            Grace Castañeda in a 6 a.m. press briefing. At the moment the tropical depression outside PAR was located some 1,503 kilometers east of 
            extreme Northern Luzon while moving southward at the speed of 20kilometers per hour (kph), she said. It has maximum sustained winds of 55kph 
            near the center and gustiness of up to 70kph, the state-run weather agency said. Castañeda said that in 36 hours when the tropical depression is inside PAR, it may reach the tropical storm category.</p>
